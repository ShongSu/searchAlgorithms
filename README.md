# searchAlgorithms
Java project simulates: Bread first search, Depth first search and Uniform cost search upon specified world.

# Description  
The following undirected weighted graph represents the connectivity between various cities in Romania. Each edge means that there is a bidirectional path between the connecting nodes. The number on the edges represents the cost to travel from one city to another. 


# Achivements
1. Represent this world using an adjacency matrix (or another data structure of your choice). 
2. Implement the following uninformed search algorithms: 
	a. Bread first search 
	b. Depth first search 
	c. Uniform cost search. 
3. Use a representation of the world, select an algorithm, a source city, and a destination city. 
4. Output: 
	a. The total number of nodes generated (to represent time). 
	b. The maximum number of nodes that existed in memory for any given run (to represent space). 
	c. The path (from city to another) that will lead you from source to destination using the algorithm you decided to use.
